=>  WHY USE DOCKER?
    Docker makes it easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

                IMAGE ------------------->  CONTAINER
              Single file                 Runnig instance
              with all the                 of an image.
              deps and config
              required to run
              a program

=> Docker software consist of two software:
   1) Docker Client (Docker cli) - Tool that we are going to issue commands
   2) Docker Server (Docker Daemon)- Tool that is responsible for creating images, running contrainers,etc


=>  What happen when we execute docker run command:

                                  Your computer                   Docker Hub
                                                      __________>
    docker run hello-world ------> Docker Client     !  !------> hello-world
                                        !            !  !           redis
                                   Docker Server------  !
                                                        !
                                    image cache         !
                                        Hello   <-------!
                                        world
    
    1)  We execute command on docker cli
    2)  Cli then send command to docker Server
    3)  Docker Server checks for the local cpoy of the image.
    4)  If server found the image then it runs the image to form a container.
    5)  Else, server download the hello-world image and store it locally for future,
        then runs the image to form a container.

=>  what is a container?
    A container is a running program along with the portion of the computer resources required for the
    processing.

=>  When docker is installed in the windows/ mac machine then, it uses a LINUX VIRTUAL MACHINE (for 
    Namespacing & control groups, as these are the features of Linux operation system). Then the kernel of
    this linux virtual machine is used to perform Namespacing and control groups to run the containers, in
    the windows/mac machine 

=>  Unless and until we make a connection between two containers, they remains in complete isolation

=>  Creating an Image
    
            Dockerfile  ----->   Docker Client  ------>  Docker Server  ------>  Usable Image
    
    ->  Create a dockerfile
            1) Specify a base image                                 (Is a kind of OS in computer)
            2) Run some commands to install additional programs     (all the steps required to download and
                                                                     install the chrome)
            3) Specify a command to run on container startup        (command required to start the chrome)
    
    ->  Example of a Dockerfile

     Instruction
    telling docker
     server what         Argument to
       to do            the instruction

        FROM                alpine
        RUN                 apk add --update redis       (apk is a package manager in the alpine image)
        CMD                 ["redis-server"]

    ->  how a Dockerfile is executed

    1)  Docker server download the base image from docker Hub
    2)  Then docker server find the next instruction to be RUN and picks the docker image download in the
        previous step.
        It then create a container for that image and execute the argument in the RUN isntruction.
        It then download the redis in the hard-disk namespace and create a file-system snapshot, assign
        an ID to that image and shutdown the temporary container.
    3)  Now docker server find the next instruction to be CMD and picks the docker image download in the
        previous step.
        It then create a container for that image and set the command that is to be executed in the future
        when this image will be run. Again it create a file-system snapshot, assign an ID
        to that image and shutdown the temporary container.

        Any time we make change to a Dockerfile, docker daemon will going to run only the series of
        steps from the CHANGED LINE ON DOWN.
