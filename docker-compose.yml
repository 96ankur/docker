#This docker-compose.yml file tells Docker to do the following:

# Pull the image we uploaded in from the registry.
# Run 5 instances of that image as a service called web, limiting each one to use, at most, 10% of a single core of CPU time (this could also be e.g. “1.5” to mean 1 and half core for each), and 50MB of RAM.
# Immediately restart containers if one fails.
# Map port 4000 on the host to web’s port 8080.
# Instruct web’s containers to share port 8080 via a load-balanced network called webnet. (Internally, the containers themselves publish to web’s port 8080 at an ephemeral port.)
# Define the webnet network with the default settings (which is a load-balanced overlay network).
